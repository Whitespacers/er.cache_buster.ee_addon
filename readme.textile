h1. Cache Buster

An ExpressionEngine plugin that adds a simple cache buster to your flat file references


h2. Compatibility

* ExpressionEngine 1.6.x


h2. Purpose

Using ExpressionEngine's CSS template provides a nice cache buster string of the most recent time
the template was saved to the database. This is quite handy but still requires EE to process the template.

This plugin will take a file path and use PHP to check the modification time returning a cache busting
string like ExpressionEngine's. This allows you to server flat files from your server without having
ExpressionEngine's template parser run through the code first. It is very simple to use.


h2. Usage

There are 2 parameters. One is required and the other is optional.

<pre><code>{exp:cache_buster file="/css/style.css"}</code></pre>

This will return

<pre><code>/css/style.css?v=1266264101</code></pre>

Where "1266264101" is the UNIX timestamp of the last time /css/style.css was saved to the server.

You can change the separator between the file and the timestamp with the use of separator="" in the tag.

<pre><code>{exp:cache_buster file="/css/style.css" separator="?"}</code></pre>

This will return

<pre><code>/css/style.css?1266264101</code></pre>
